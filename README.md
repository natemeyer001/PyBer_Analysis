# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Explore how PyBer ride-sharing data differs by the type of city: urban, suburban, rural. Namely, what are the average fares per ride for each, as well as the average fare per driver.


## Results

### Total Rides
Urban had the majority at 68.4% of the total, followed by suburban with 26.3% and then rural with 5.3%
### Total Drivers
Urban had the lion's share with 80.9%, with suburban coming in second with 16.5%, and rural coming in last again at 2.6%
### Average Fare per Ride
Rural had the most expensive ride, followed by suburban and urban, with gaps of around $5 by city type.
### Average Fare per Drvier
Rural had the highest average at over three times what urban had. Yet again suburban was in the middle.


## Summary

As was expected, most of the rides took place in the urban cities and most of the drivers were there as well. However, the supply was greater than the demanad which brought down the average fares to be the lowest of the bunch. I would recommend shifting some drivers away from the urban cities to bring up the average fare per driver. At the same time, I would make sure that the consumers are still happy with their experience (ensure wait times aren't getting too large, as well as average fare ride.) 
I would strongly advise for more suburban drivers since the suburbs account for 30.5% of the total fares, which is higher than their ride share and driver share. 
Lastly, I would dig deeper into the customer's and driver's experiences in the rural cities. The average fare per driver is very high and the total fare % is higher than the ride %, which suggests that there might be a shortage in supply. However, the average fare per driver does not account for the fact that rural areas have a higher wait time between rides, which means the driver's true hourly average is over-stated.
